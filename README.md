# Exploratory-Project

Your project needs to:

Demonstrate abstraction. We have done this a lot. Any time we take code that we've written and turn it into a function or a class, that is an example of us employing abstraction. Your project needs to make use of a class you design and implement.

Employ useful functions. We have also done this a lot. Your project needs to include functions that you design and implement. You need to use parameters and return values effectively. Not every function needs to use either or both, but you need to demonstrate understanding of both. 

Be a product of thoughtful design. You will describe what you want to achieve, then break that description down into class and function/method descriptions in pseudocode and in terms of foundational programming elements: data/variables, conditionals, iteration/recursion, functions, abstraction. 

Be a product of iterative development. You should use github to track your progress through commits with descriptions. 

Troubleshooting. Your program should work. You should also provide evidence of difficulties encountered and how you overcame them.

If you would like to engage in this project, you need craft a written proposal. Create a github repository for this project. In your README.md file,  address the following things:

A description of what your final product will be. What will it do? 


A description of the things you want to learn by doing this project.
